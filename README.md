# Spell-O-Rama

# Overview

This is a spelling application created for K-12 school students. The app starts out with you choosing your grade (either k-6 or 7-12), depending on your choice it will send you to another screen to let you choose the difficulty based on your grade. Once the difficulty is chosen you're directed to a game mode selection screen where you can choose what game you would like to play. The current version only has the game hangman. The game itself runs as follows: you select a letter on the keyboard, if the letter is correct, the letter appears on screen as a solved portion of the unkown word, if incorrect, a hangman stick figure will continually be added upon until a lose screen. If you guess the word, you get a win screen. Further work is planned to implement different games. The difficulty level is based on the words used. The higher the difficulty (grade) you choose, the harder the words.
